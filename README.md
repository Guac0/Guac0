# Hi, I'm Andrew! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a university student with a minor networking background currently studying cybersecurity as an undergraduate student in the USA. I'm an active competitor in this field â€” if you've been participating in CyberPatriot over the past few years then I might've been right next to you on the scoreboards, and now that I'm in college I've jumped right into several live Red vs. Blue competitions as a Blue Teamer (aka: defense). I've experimented with some offensive tactics and CTF skills as well, and I plan to get involved there as well moving forward!

## Projects ðŸ“‹

I possess a security toolset of both original and non-original works to help me with Blue Teaming (defense) competitions, with a focus on Linux as that's usually where my team needs help. Most of my cybersecurity-related work is in private repositories outside of competition season to make an attempt at preserving team secrets, but feel free to poke around whatever I have public at the moment! Unless otherwise noted, feel free to reverse engineer and reuse my code, just please attach a little shoutout in your code comments :)

Outside of the realm of cybersecurity, I dabble in whatever catches my interests, although what's publicly available flunctuates depending on a few factors. In particular, I've created a [mission framework](https://github.com/Guac0/TAS-Mission-Template) for the cooperative videogame Arma 3, which still sees widespread use in the TAS community and elsewhere to this day. I attribute this to my focus on providing a feature rich but user friendly product, as it's absolutely crammed full of helpful features with a comprehensive writeup on common portions of it, plus even some video guides! Again, feel free to use anything you see in according to the (usually quite permissive) license.

## Stats ðŸ’¬

I used to have a Top Langs chart here but it kept telling everyone 99% of my projects were written in C++ for some reason...

Currently, I have projects using the following languages:
1. Python
2. Java
3. Bash
4. Batch (and some Powershell)
5. SQL
6. and finally, SQF (Status Quo Function, the scripting language that Arma uses).
