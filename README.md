# Hi, I'm Andrew!

I'm a university student currently studying cybersecurity as a undergraduate student in the USA. I'm an active competitor in this field â€” if you've been participating in CyberPatriot over the past few years then I might've been right next to you on the scoreboards, and now that I'm in college I've leapt into the various live red vs. blue competitions as a blue teamer with gusto. Still honing my CTF skills though, but we'll get there!

Most of my cybersecurity-related work is in private repositories outside of competition season to make an attempt at preserving team secrets, but feel free to poke around whatever I have public at the moment! Unless otherwise noted, feel free to reverse engineer and reuse my code, just please attach a little shoutout in your code comments :)

Outside of the realm of cybersecurity, I dabble in whatever catches my interests, although what's publicly available flunctuates depending on a few factors. In particular, I've created a [mission framework](https://github.com/Guac0/TAS-Mission-Template) for the cooperative videogame Arma 3, which still sees widespread use in the TAS community to this day (and given the occasional furtive DM for support on some issue or another, likely quite a few more communities as well). Again, feel free to use anything you see in according to the (usually quite permissive) license!

I used to have a Top Langs chart here but it kept telling everyone 99% of my projects were written in C++ for some reason, so I'll just self-report and say that I play around with Python, Java, Bash, Batch, SQL, and SQF (for non-Arma people, Status Quo Function, the scripting language Arma uses).
